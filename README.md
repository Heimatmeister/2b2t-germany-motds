# 2b2t-germany-motds
allows players of 2b2t germany to request an MOTD to be used with the rest of the random ones


rules for requesting an MOTD:

no advertising your own server, i can guarentee its probably shitty and the hardware is far worse (i can say this since my hardware is and always will be far more superior)

no bullshitting

follow the format already provided in config.yml

any advertising will result in your username being written down and forever denied

all requests must be from a pull request, any issues made will not be acknowledged

Your MOTD may not make it due to an issue, if it doesnt ill let you know and show you how to fix it, this means dont bitch about it be patient
